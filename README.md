# lib Hardware performance data

### This software is not production ready. Please review the source before attempting to use.

A library for quickly and easily accessing data about hardware performance on linux-based systems.
This is mainly a learning project for now and only includes a minimal set of functions.
If you do use this software, please compile from source, as binary releases will be far and few between for now.
